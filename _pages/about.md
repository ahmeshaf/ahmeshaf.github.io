Research Scientist at Center for Advanced AI, Accenture. PhD in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder mentored by
[James H. Martin](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/) and Martha Palmer. My research interest lies in the fundamental understanding of actions and events in language and efficient Natural Language Processing. 
My most recent projects revolve around efficiently fitting the entire world in an LLM's context window. I also interned twice at [explosion.ai](https://explosion.ai/) (makers of [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)).
